# Git branches

Git branches store all files in Github. It can be thought as parallel copy of a repository.

## Main branch

The main branch stores the deployable code.

## Other branches

When you plan to change the code:

1.  Create a new branch:

-   Command line: in the local repository of interest (previously you have changed to the local repository using cd and make sure that the local repository is a git repository which means that you have used `git init` in the directory of interest), use `git checkout -b "name of branch"`. This new branch is a exact copy of the original branch.
-   Github: in the repository of interest, go to tab "master", and fill in the space that indicates "Find or create a branch"

2.  Work on the new branch. Once the new code is finished, we have two branches: the original and the copy.

3.  When both branches are ready to join, the code of each branch is called the tip of each branch.

4.  Merge the branches: the two tips of the branch are merged into a new tip that belongs to the original branch that contains the deployable branch.

1.  Clone the repository `git clone URL`

2.  Create branch `git branch BRANCH_NAME`

3.  Switch to the new branch using `git checkout BRANCH_NAME`

4.  Modify the targeted file

5.  Check modifications using `git status`

6.  Stage changes using `git add FILE_NAME`

7.  Commit changes using `git commit -m "Message"`

8.  Switch back to the main branch using `git checkout main`

9.  Merge branches using `git merge`

10. Make the changes accessible to the remote repository using `git push -u origin main`

11. Check if changes have been done using `git status`

# Main branch

In RStudio, we might get instead of main master. To change it:

`usethis::git_default_branch_rename(from = "master", to = "main")`

To configure it as default:

`usethis::git_default_branch_configure(name ="main")`
