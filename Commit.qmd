# Git commit

- A commit is a saved change of files.  For instance, we changed a file and we want to save it.  In word, we would click save.  In Git, we need to use commit. 
- Important: we need to add a commit message which has to describe correctly the changes done. 
-   Commit changes to the file:
    -   In the terminal (assuming you are already in the directory of the local git rpository):
        -   `git add .` (This allows to upload the file to a staging area)
        -   `git commit -m "message"`

    -   In Github
