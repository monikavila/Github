# Forking and cloning

## Cloning

1.  Definition

-   Copy of the repository in your local machine
-   Cloned copies can sync between locations

2.  How to clone using command line? `git clone URL`
3.  Syncing local changes

-   Add files to the staging area `git add files`

-   Commit changes `git commit -m message`

-   Transfer changes to the remote repository `git push`

-   Transfer changes from the remote repo `git fetch`

-   Transfer changes from the remote repo to the local repo and merge
    them to a branch `git pull`

-   Upstream: refers to the original work

-   Origin refers to your fork

## Forking

-   Modifies or extends a project without affecting the original project
-   Submit changes to the original repo
-   Independently make changes to a project, by submitting a pull
    request
-   Keep a copy of the license

It can be used to:

-   Work on a project independently
-   Use a repository as the base for a new project

We can also use RStudio following

### Keep syncing a Fork of a project

1.  Create a local clone of the project `git clone URL`
2.  Configure GIT to sync the fork (To understand better)

-   Open a terminal and change to the directory containing the local
    clone
-   Access the remote repository `git remote -v`
-   Type `git remote add upstream <clone directory>`

### Fork workflow

1.  Fork the "Original" Github repo on github webpage
2.  Clone the new Origin repo to create a local repo
3.  Keep syncked the fork (set up a remote for the original )
4.  Make changes in your local repo and then push them to the Origin
5.  Make a pull request to send changes to the Original Forked repo

A graph of the process is given below:
