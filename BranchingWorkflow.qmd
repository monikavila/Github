# Git Branching Workflow

1.  Clone the repository `git clone URL`

2.  Create a new branch, you can use `git branch BRANCH_NAME`. But you can better use `git checkout -b BRANC_NAME`, this will create and change automatially to the new branch.

3.  Switch to the new branch using `git checkout BRANCH_NAME`

4.  Modify the targeted file

5.  Check modifications using `git status`

6.  Stage changes using `git add FILE_NAME`

7.  Commit changes using `git commit -m "Message"`

7.5 Push the changes to the target branch `git push -u origin Target_branch_name`. This step is important to push the branch that was created to make the changes to GitHub.

8.  Switch back to the main branch using `git checkout main`

9.  Merge branches using `git merge BRANCH_FORCHANGES_NAME`

10. Make the changes accessible to the remote repository using `git push -u origin main`

11. Check if changes have been done using `git status`

12. Now you can go to GitHub and check that you have three branches.

13. In GitHub you can ask for a pull request
